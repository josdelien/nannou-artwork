# nannou-artwork

### Project decription
This project contains a (growing) number of subfolders each individually containing generative artwork algorithms I have developed using the Rust [Nannou project](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou), which itself is a toolkit for so-called "creative coding" in the Rust programming language.
If you are also interesting in learning how to code in Rust and want to try out generative art programming, you might find this project of mine - as my own exploration of creating generative art in Rust - useful.
